# Camera-Classifier
A real-time camera input classifier using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Tkinter to capture, label, train, and predict between two categories.

The Camera Classifier project is a machine learning application that uses a computer's camera to classify live input into two predefined categories. It captures images in real-time, processes them, and allows the user to label them into two classes for training. Once trained, the model can predict and display which class the current camera input belongs to. The project leverages OpenCV for image capture and TensorFlow for training, providing an interactive interface for classifying objects or patterns through a simple GUI.
